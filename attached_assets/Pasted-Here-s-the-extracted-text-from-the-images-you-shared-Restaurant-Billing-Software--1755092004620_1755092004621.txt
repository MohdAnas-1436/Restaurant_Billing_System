## Restaurant Billing Software

**Objective:**
Build a Python-based billing system for restaurants that handles order entry, bill generation with tax/discounts, and reporting. The system should support Dine-In and Takeaway modes and save transactions with payment details.

**Tools & Libraries:**

* Python
* Tkinter (for GUI) or Streamlit (for Web UI)
* SQLite3 (for storing menu, orders)
* datetime (for timestamps)
* pandas (for reports/export)
* reportlab / fpdf (optional: for printable PDF bills)

---

### Mini Guide (Step-by-Step Tasks)

**1. Menu Setup + Database**

* Use sqlite3 to create a menu table (item name, category, price, GST).
* Also create orders and order\_items tables to track transactions.

**2. Build the UI**
Use Tkinter or Streamlit to:

* Upload menu (admin)
* Select Dine-In or Takeaway
* Add/remove items to an order
* Show running total

**3. Order Management & Calculations**

* Capture selected items and quantity.
* Auto-calculate subtotal + GST (e.g., 5%) + discount (optional).
* Select payment method: Cash / Card / UPI
* Show final total with breakdown.

**4. Bill Generation**

* Display itemized bill on screen.
* Allow export:

  * As PDF (optional) using fpdf
  * As CSV or JSON using pandas

**5. Data Storage**

* Store every completed bill:

  * Items, total amount, GST, payment method, date & time
* Save to SQLite database

**6. Reports Module**

* Daily/weekly/monthly sales summary
* Most sold items
* Export as CSV

### Deliverables

* **Complete Python Codebase**
* **GUI or Web UI (Tkinter or Streamlit)**
* **5 Sample Orders + Menu File**
* **Database File (.db)**
* **CSV/JSON Export Examples (Bills & Reports)**
* **README file with setup steps**

### Test Items

Include these 5 dummy test bills (Dine-In + Takeaway) to simulate:

* Orders with multiple items
* GST only
* GST + Discount
* UPI vs Cash payments
* **Edge case:** No item selected

### Optional Enhancements

* Add login page for Admin/Cashier
* Auto-print or share bill (email/WhatsApp)
* Live clock + table management (for dine-in)

Do you want me to now **start building the full Python project based on this extracted specification**? This would include all files and folder structure exactly as described.
